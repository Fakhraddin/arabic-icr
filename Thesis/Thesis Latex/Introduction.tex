%Instructions - How to write an introduction:
%-------------------------------------------------
%You can't write a good introduction until you know what the body of the paper says. Consider writing the introductory section(s) after you have completed the rest of the paper, rather than before.
%Be sure to include a hook at the beginning of the introduction. This is a statement of something sufficiently interesting to motivate your reader to read the rest of the paper, it is an important/interesting scientific problem that your paper either solves or addresses. You should draw the reader in and make them want to read the rest of the paper.
%
%The next paragraphs in the introduction should cite previous research in this area. It should cite those who had the idea or ideas first, and should also cite those who have done the most recent and relevant work. You should then go on to explain why more work was necessary (your work, of course.) 
% 
%What else belongs in the introductory section(s) of your paper? 
%A statement of the goal of the paper: why the study was undertaken, or why the paper was written. Do not repeat the abstract. 
%Sufficient background information to allow the reader to understand the context and significance of the question you are trying to address. 
%Proper acknowledgement of the previous work on which you are building. Sufficient references such that a reader could, by going to the library, achieve a sophisticated understanding of the context and significance of the question. 
%The introduction should be focused on the thesis question(s).  All cited work should be directly relevent to the goals of the thesis.  This is not a place to summarize everything you have ever read on a subject.
%Explain the scope of your work, what will and will not be included. 
%A verbal "road map" or verbal "table of contents" guiding the reader to what lies ahead. 
%Is it obvious where introductory material ("old stuff") ends and your contribution ("new stuff") begins? 
%Remember that this is not a review paper. We are looking for original work and interpretation/analysis by you. Break up the introduction section into logical segments by using subheads.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Handwriting Recognition}

\nomenclature{$HWR$}{Handwriting recognition}
\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Motivation}}{}
Writing, which has made much of the culture and civilization possible, was developed a long time ago as a mean to expand human memory and to facilitate communication. 
Nowadays, it remains a commonly used mean of communication and recording of information in the daily life, and therefore, a growing interest in the \emph{handwriting character recognition} (HWR) field has emerged in recent years, and has now been a topic of research for over four decades.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{HWR Motivation 1 - handwriting survival}}{}
Despite the long standing prediction that digital computers will challenge its future, handwriting persists. 
Producing documents was hugely simplified by computers, however, the pen and paper are still the natural medium for many important tasks. For instance, note taking in classrooms is a task that can still be done more efficiently by hand for most users. 
The ease and convenience of having information in digital form provides a powerful incentive to find a way of quickly converting handwritten text into its digital equivalent.
Not only this is useful for making digital copies of handwritten documents, but also in many automated processing tasks, such as searching, indexing, automatic mail sorting, cheque processing, etc.. \cite{noaparast2009persian,connell2000online}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{HWR Motivation 2 - Keyboard-less devices}}{}
Other motivation for HWR is the rapid transition from personal computers and laptops to the usage of smart-phones and tablets devices that are too small to have full sized keyboards, or sometimes may be too small for any keyboard at all, requiring pen, hand gestures, figure gestures or voice interface to enter data. 

\nomenclature{$OCR$}{Optical character recognition}
\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{HWR as OCR}}{}
HWR is a special case of emph{optical character recognition} (OCR). HWR was defined by Plamondon and Srihari as "the task of transforming a language represented in its spatial form of graphical marks into its symbolic representation" \cite{plamondon2000online}.
It is a skill that is personal to individuals, thus, the task of HWR is considered a difficult pattern recognition problem. 
 
\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{HWR as OCR}}{} 
OCR is defined as the process of electronically converting a scanned, photoed or sensed of both typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. It has been steadily evolving during its history. It has always been a favorite testing ground for new ideas in pattern recognition giving rise to an exciting set of research topics and producing many powerful practical applications.
However, since many experiments of new ideas in pattern recognition were conducted on isolated characters, the results are not always immediately reflected in OCR applications.
OCR is considered one of the best applications of machine vision and one of the most successful research branches in pattern recognition theory. 
Although considered a well developed technological field, OCR remains an area of active scientific research and creative engineering. 
It is widely used today in a wide range of projects, from occasional document scanning to creation of massive digital document archives. \cite{burrow2004arabic, borovikov2004survey} 

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{HW types of analysis}}{}
Besides recognition, handwriting is associated with other types of analysis, such as, signature verification, writer identification, etc...

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Levels of difficulties in HWR}}{}
There are different types with varying complexity of problems within HWR, which is based on how the data is presented to the recognition system, at what level the data can be unambiguously broke into pieces (e.g. individual characters or words), and the transcription complexity of the language used. 
Latin handwriting can appear in several forms which impose a different recognition difficulties. The \textbf{cursive script} form, which is the most common type of day-to-day script, is the text in which words, or portion of a word, is written with a single stroke, i.e, ligatures connect adjacent letters. 
The \textbf{hand-printed script} is the case where the writing still represents an entire word sequence, but succeeding characters are explicitly segmented by a pen lift; though, the character segmentation problem is still not solved as pen lifts can also occur within a character. 
Another form is the \textbf{isolated characters} form, in which the segmentation problem is already solved, for instance by the acquisition interface and the cooperation of the writer. 
Graphical boxes or timeouts are common interface techniques for this purpose .
The recognition difficulty decreases from the first listed type to the last. Indeed, HWR systems have a strong history in making use of this graduation in difficulty. They have aimed (and still aim) at a reasonable user satisfaction by restricting the text input to a simpler handwriting type, while simultaneously rewarding the user with recognition accuracy \cite{burrow2004arabic}.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The cursive nature of the Arabic handwriting}}{}
However, in the Arabic language, the only case is the cursive, in both handwritten and printed text.
One problem in unconstrained HWR is the huge variety in the writing of different people. 
Another extreme difficulty is the so-called segmentation, that is, the process of dividing an entire writing into sub-units (typically characters) \cite{bahlmann2005advanced}.

\subsection{Off-line versus On-line Handwriting Recognition}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Introduction}}{}
The field of HWR can be classified in several ways. However, the most common categorization is the one that distinguish between off-line (also called static) and on-line (also called dynamic) HWR.
In the off-line case, a digital image containing text is fed to the computer, and the system attempts to convert the spatial representation of the letters into digital symbols \cite{al2011online}. Off-line HWR focuses on documents that have been written on paper at some previous point of time. 
In contrast, on-line HWR is performed on a digital representation of the text written on a special digitizer, tablet or smart-phone device, where sensors pick up the pen-tip movements.
The two-dimensional coordinates of successive points of the writing as a function of time are stored in order, i.e., the order of strokes made by the writer is readily available. 

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Similarities and advantages of on-line and off-line}}{}
While this sequence can be used to construct a static image of the writing, thus allowing off-line character recognition techniques to be applied, it has been shown that the information about the pen dynamics can be used to obtain a better recognition accuracies than the static data alone. In addition, the difficulty of recreating the temporal data has led to few such feature extraction systems so far \cite{plamondon2000online}. Figure \ref{fig:offline_vs_online} shows typical input signals that can be analyzed in both cases.
An advantage of on-line handwritten data over off-line data is the availability of the stroke segmentation and the order of writing. 
Ink in static images must first be separated from the image background, creating a potential source of error. 
The ability to detect the states of "pen-down" (when the pen touches the tablet or the finger touches the touch screen) and "pen-up" can also be used.

   \label{fig:offline_vs_online}
\end{figure}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{State of the art HWR}}{}
HWR is no longer an esoteric topic on the fringes of information technology, but a mature discipline that has many commercial usages.
On-line systems for handwriting recognition are available in hand-held computers such as PDAs.
Off-line systems are less accurate than on-line systems.
However, they are now good enough that they have a significant economic impact on for specialized domains such as interpreting handwritten postal addresses on envelopes and reading courtesy amounts on bank checks.
The success of on-line systems makes it attractive to consider developing off-line systems that first estimate the trajectory of the writing from off-line data and then use pen-tip are recorded as a function of time with a digitizer.
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The Holistic versus the Analytic Approach}
\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{off-line HWR general recognition scheme}}{}
There are many approaches for off-line handwriting recognition, and one may find it very difficult to draw a general scheme that outlines the flow of HWR approaches or procedures. However, there are several stages that can be found in most approaches.
\begin{itemize}
\item preprocessing
\item feature extraction
\item classification algorithm
\end{itemize}
The preprocessing stage usually consists of smoothing, writing flow reconstruction, purification, and more.  

\emph{TODO: talk in general about the flow of handwriting recognition and then go into the differences between the off-line and the on-line}\\

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{A general flow for handwriting recognition}}{}
{\color{blue}In a document image, first step is layout analysis and extraction of text lines. Then each text line is segmented into isolated individual character images. In final, these character images are sent to the classifier and the corresponding class labels are obtained. The whole process is straightforward for well printed/well written documents and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow_diagram_ocr} \cite{saba2010survey}.}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./figures/flow_diagram_ocr}       
\caption{Generic Handwriting Recognition Process \cite{saba2010survey}}
\label{fig:flow_diagram_ocr}
\end{figure}


\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Common stages of on-line Arabic handwriting recognition system}}{}
As mentioned before, in an on-line handwriting recognition system, the stylos motion is sampled at equal time intervals and pass the information to the recognition algorithm. The samples goes through preprocessing stage that include filtering of noises, re-sampling the stroke information to obtain equidistant stroke, and normalized to a standard size. Additional preprocessing may include slant and slope corrections. Then, depending on the nature of the system, the trajectory may undergoes segmentation into basic units and each unit is labeled, or the word or the WP is classified as a whole. A preprocessing stage usually include using a lexicon/language soecific model to search for the most likely string, see Figure \ref{fig:online_generic_process} \cite{beigi1993overview}.

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./figures/online_generic_process}       
\caption{Generic Handwriting Recognition Process \cite{beigi1993overview}}
\label{fig:online_generic_process}
\end{figure}


\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{problems imposed by the open vocabulary}}{}
While there exist a wide variety of approaches to cursive script recognition, research in this field has established two main approaches, one is the analytic approach \cite{abdulla2008off, sari2002off, dinges2011offine, elanwar2012unconstrained}, and the other is the holistic approach \cite{biadsy2011segmentation}. 

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The analytic approach}}{}
The analytic approach involves segmentation of the input curve (that represents a word) into basic units (usually letters) and classification of each part of the text into individual characters, which are recognized and then assembled to identify the written word. 
The advantage of this approach is that it requires to maintain only a small set of trained models - one for each letter shape - to handle large vocabulary. however, the absence of consistent baselines, large variations in writing styles, and seamless connection between letters (connection is done with almost no ligatures)make segmentation into individual letters almost impossible. \cite{saabni2009hierarchical}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The holistic approach}}{}
The holistic approach (also called a global approach) considers the global properties of the written text and recognizes the input word shape as a whole. 
{Most popular methods among this group are based on analysis of the number and order of ascenders, descenders, loops and vertical strokes. They often rely on heavy dictionary searching that is costly and prone to be mislead by spelling errors. \cite{brodowska2011oversegmentation}}

While it avoids the error-prone segmentation process the holistic approach, the recognition system needs to be trained over all words in the dictionary and to maintain and train models for each word. 
It may be possible for small vocabulary of words, however, this is not feasible for large vocabularies (20,000 words or more). 
Since each word is constructed from a subset of the character alphabet, it is much more efficient to classify words using the analytic approach \cite{elanwar2012unconstrained}.\\

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The similarities}}{}
Although HWR processes and approaches may differ, we can safely expect that any OCR algorithm would posses these two essential components:
\begin{itemize}
\item a feature extractor, and
\item a classifier
\end{itemize}
Given an item image, the feature extractor derives the features (descriptors) that the item possesses. The derived features are then used as input to the classifier that determines the (most likely) known item corresponding to the observed features. The classifier is also expected to give a confidence level number that tells how certain the classifier is about the recognized item.


\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Trends in pattern recognitions techniques}}{}
The are some leading pattern recognition techniques, which can be encoutered frequently, when reviewing the field of on-line handwriting recognition.
Techniques such as \emph{hidden Markov models} (HMM) and \emph{neural networks} are encountered frequently.
More details will be provided in Section \ref{[]}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Closed Vocabulary vs. Open Vocabulary}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Importance of the dictionary size}}{}
The vocabulary, from which the words in the test set are taken, has a major impact on how difficult the HWR task is.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Closed and open vocabulary definitions}}{}
Closed-vocabulary HWR system is capable of recognizing words from a predetermined limited size dictionary. 
The restricted vocabulary set is usually called a lexicon.
There are no established definitions for the lexicon size, however, the following terms are usually used:
\begin{itemize}
\item small lexicon - tens of words.
\item medium lexicon - hundreds of words.
\item large lexicon - thousands of words.
\item very large lexicon - tens of thousands of words.
\end{itemize}
Open-vocabulary tasks refer to recognition of any words without the constraint of being in a dictionary.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Recognition difficulty}}{}
Closed-vocabulary tasks are easier than open-vocabulary ones because only certain subsequences of letters are possible when limited by a dictionary.
The vocabulary size is a common constraint of current recognition systems. 
Most current HWR systems are able to handle small and medium size lexicons.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{problems imposed by the open vocabulary}}{}
The lexicon is a key-point post-processing stage in many systems, because the linguistic knowledge helps to filter out many possible options that are not included in the lexicon, and consequently raise the recognition rate.
The adhesion to a some limited dictionary, may also limit the computational complexity. 
Although most research efforts have been devoted to closed vocabulary systems, open vocabulary systems has also been proposed.
However, their accuracy is still far below those relying on a small vocabulary \cite{koerich2003large, shu1996line}.

\subsection{Arabic Handwriting Recognition}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Scripts}}{}
{Each script has a set of icons, which are known as characters or letters, that have certain basic shapes. 
There are rules for combining letters to represent shapes of higher level linguistic units. 
For example, there are rules for combining the shapes of individual letters so as to form cursively written words in the Latin alphabet  \cite{plamondon2000online}}.


\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{HWR field}}{}
{Off-line Arabic HWR and segmentation has been a popular field of research for many years. It still remains an open problem.The challenging nature of handwriting recognition and segmentation has attracted the attention of researchers from industry and academic circles. \cite{al2010development}}


\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The Arabic Trend}}{}
After a long period of focus on western and East Asian scripts there is now a general trend to explore other scripts such as Arabic and various Indic scripts. 

%\emph{TODO:see the in introduction of \cite{abandah2009analysis}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Motivation}
%\emph{See \cite{lorigo2006offline} - motivation section}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The Arabic language spread}}{}
The Arabic language is spoken as their first language by nearly 350 million people around the world \cite{zeki2011segmentation}, and written by more than 100 million people, in over 20 different countries, which makes it one of the five most common languages in the world and one of the six United Nations official languages since 1974\cite{burrow2004arabic}. 
Although Arabic is used mainly in the Arab countries, which is about 5.5\% of the world population, almost all Muslims, around 25\% of the world population can read Arabic script as it is the language of the Holy Qur'an \cite{zeki2011segmentation}.


\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The Arabic History}}{}
The Arabic script is one of the descendants of the Aramaic script. 
The earliest known document written using the Arabic script is dating from 512 AD.  
The reason there are some letters in the Arabic script that differ only by dots is the that new letters were created around the 7th century by adding dots to existing Armaic letters \cite{burrow2004arabic}.
The old Arabic was written without dots or diacritics. The dots were first introduced by Yahya bin Ya'mur (died around 746 AD) and Nasr bin Asim (died around 707 AD), students of Abu Al-Aswad Al-Du'ali (died around 688 AD) who introduced the diacritics to prevent the 
Qur'an from being misread by Muslims \cite{zeki2011segmentation}.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The Arabic Alphabet usage in other languages}}{}
{Due to the Islamic conquests, the use of Arabic language extended in the 7th and 8th centuries from India to the Atlantic Ocean (Al- Fakhri, 1997). Consequently, more than twenty different languages adopted the Arabic alphabet with some changes, such as Farsi, Urdu, Malay, Housa and Ottoman Turkish \cite{saabni2009efficient,jannoud2007automatic}. }
However, it must be mentioned that some of those languages are currently using Latin characters, but in general, people can still read the Arabic script.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Literary vs. daily language}}{}
{The literary language is called Modern Standard Arabic or Literary Arabic which is a Pluricentric language. 
It is currently the only official form of Arabic, used in most written documents as well as in formal spoken occasions, such as lectures and news broadcasts. However, this varies from one country to the other.[wikipedia]}
Other small marks (diacritics) are used to indicate short vowels, often heard and in written when using the standard Arabic are seldom used in day-to-day communication and handwriting. \cite{burrow2004arabic}
Although the spoken Arabic is slightly different from country to country, the written Arabic is standard system used all over the Arab world \cite{saabni2009efficient,jannoud2007automatic}.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The growing interest in the Arabic HWR}}{}
{Despite the fact that Arabic alphabets are used in many languages, Arabic Character Recognition (ACR) has not received enough interests from researchers. Little research progress has been achieved as compared to the one done on Latin or Chinese. It has almost only started in 1975 by Nazif (1975), while the earlier research efforts in Latin may be traced back to the middle of the 1940s. However, due to a lack of computing power, no significant work was performed until the 1980s. Recent years have shown a considerable increase in the number of research papers related to ACR. \cite{zeki2011segmentation}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Characteristic of the Arabic writing system}
Arabic Scripts consists of 28 basic letters, 12 additional special letters, and 8 diacritics. 
Arabic script is written from right to left in a semi-cursive manner in both printed and handwritten. 
Most letters are written in four different letter shapes depending on their position in a word, e.g., the letter \RL{`}  (Ain) appears as \RL{`} (isolated), \RL{`-}(initial),\RL{-`-} (medial) and \RL{-`} (final). Among the basic letters, six are Disconnective - \RL{A} (Alef), \RL{d} (Dal), \RL{_d} (Thal), \RL{r} (Reh), \RL{z} (Zain) and \RL{w} (Waw). 
Disconnective letters do not connect to the following letter and have only two shapes each. 
The presence of this letters interrupts the continuity of the graphic form of a word. 
We denote connected letters in a word, as word-part. 
If the word-part is composed of only one letter, this letter will be in its isolated shape \cite{biadsy2011segmentation}. 

Certain characteristics relating to the obligatory dots and strokes of the Arabic script distinguish it from Roman script, making the recognition of words in Arabic more difficult than in Roman script. First, Most Arabic letters contain dots in addition to the letter body, such as \RL{s} (Sheen) which consists of \RL{s} (Seen) body and three dots above it. In addition to dots, there are stroke that can attach to a letter body creating new letter such as \RL{k}, \RL{.t} and \RL{lA}. These dots and strokes are called delayed strokes since they are usually drawn last in the in handwritten word-part/word. Second, eliminating, adding or moving a dot or stroke could produce a completely different letter and, as a result, produce a word other than the one that was intended (see Table 1). Third, the number of possible variations of delayed strokes is greater than those in Roman scripts, as shown in Figure 2. There are only three such strokes used for English: the cross in the letter t, the slash in x, and the dots in i and j. 

{The Arabic language has some diacritics that are used in the holy book Qur'an and sometimes in teaching material and poetry. These diacritics are small markings used above or below the letters of a word to specify the exact pronunciation of the word. They are not commonly used in the daily, scientific, and business uses, and are not discussed further in this work.\cite{abandah2009analysis}}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Word parts count}}{}    
Saabni and El-sana have explored a large collection of Arabic texts and extracted 300,000 different word combinations of 82,000 different word-parts. Ignoring the additional strokes reduced the number of different word-parts to 40,000 \cite{saabni2009efficient}. 

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Issues with Arabic Handwriting Recognition}}{} 
One difficulty with the Arabic script is the number and position of diacritic marks associated to Arabic characters.
{Recognition and segmentation of Arabic handwritten script is a difficult task because the Arabic handwritten characters are naturally both cursive and unconstrained. The analysis of Arabic script is more complicated in comparison with English script \cite{al2010development}}.

\subsection{Arabic script Segmentation}

Character segmentation is the process of splitting the handwritten script into basic units, usually corresponding to single letters or alternatively to different basic units usually named graphems. Graphemes are ... and they could be letters, couples of letters or part of a letter.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Importance}}{}
Segmentation is one of the required steps in numerous off-line and on-line cursive handwritten word recognition solutions and has long been a critical area of the OCR process. The problems of segmentation persist today. .
Its importance is derived from the fact that improperly extracted characters are usually difficult to recognize correctly. 
Wrong segmentation will often results in major contribution to the error of the recognition algorithm. 
An integral part of the hand writing recognition process, when the analytic approach is considered, is segmentation. \cite{casey1996survey, brodowska2011oversegmentation}


\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The context dependent of segmentation}}{}
{the segmentation decision is not a local decision, independent of previous and subsequent
decisions. Producing a good match to a library symbol is necessary, but not sufficient, for reliable
recognition. That is, a poor match on a later pattern can cast doubt on the correctness of the current
segmentation/recognition result. Even a series of satisfactory pattern matches can be judged incorrect if
contextual requirements on the system output are not satisfied. For example, the letter sequence "cl" can
often closely resemble a "d", but usually such a choice will not constitute a contextually valid result.}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The segmentation - recognition catch-22}}{}
{It is believed, good segmentation is one reason for high accuracy character recognition. However, the task of segmentation, while usually trivial to a human, is a very challenging pattern recognition problem.
The Catch 22 in segmentation is as follows: character is a pattern that
resembles one of the symbols the system is designed to recognize. But to determine such a resemblance
the pattern must be segmented from the document image. Each stage depends on the other, and in complex
cases it is paradoxical to seek a pattern that will match a member of the system's recognition alphabet
of symbols without incorporating detailed knowledge of the structure of those symbols into the process.
\cite{casey1996survey}}

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Cursive English segmentation - techniques and achievements}}{}
There are many known method of performing cursive letters segmentation. 
The broad range of significant real world applications and the considerable difficulty of the task both contribute to the fact that there are many known methods of performing cursive word recognition - one suited better for some applications and some for the others \cite{brodowska2011oversegmentation}
However, a correct segmentation rate is not easily achievable.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{The three approaches for segmentation}}{}
In a comprehensive survey done in \cite{casey1996survey}, the authors has pinpointed three elemental strategies for off-line cursive text segmentation in addition to many approaches that are a combinations of these three. They have noted that much of the literature on segmentation reports methods that can be characterized as a blend of these three mentioned methods.

\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Dissection}}{}
The classical approach which is usually named \emph{dissection}. 
This approach attempts to segment the text into character using "character-like" properties. 
Examples of such properties are height, width, separation from neighboring components, disposition along a baseline, etc.
Conventional approaches can segment typical words accurately. 
In this regard, different strategies such as projection profile, bounding box or contour tracing exhibit promising results. 
However, they might lead to incorrect segmentation when deal with touching characters \cite{saba2010survey}.

The catch 22 described above explains the fact that character segmentation and character classification steps are not totally separate. Degree of connection between them vary from a solution to a solution.
The second approach is recognition-based segmentation, in which the system searches for sub-components in the cursive that match letters in its alphabet. 
In this method, the recognition confidence, heavily affects the overall segmentation accuracy.
The general approach is to split words into segments that should be characters, pass each segment to a classifier and, if the classification results are not satisfactory (e.g. some measure of belief requirements is not met), call segmentation once more with the feedback information about rejecting the previous result. \cite{brodowska2011oversegmentation}

The holistic methods, in which the system seeks to recognize words as a whole, thus avoiding the segmentation process which was previously discussed in Section \ref{[]}.


\iftoggle{edit-mode}{\hspace{0pt}\marginpar{Over-segmentation}}{}
The most common methods of character segmentation is initial over - segmentation, i.e, finding some set of potential splitting points in the graphical representation of the word and then attempting to eliminate the improper ones
The segmentation task of some cursive and unconstrained nature of some languages such Arabic, anneals the segmentation task. 
The technique requires an over-segmentation stage which partition handwritten words into primitives that may then be processed further to provide the best segmentation.

In languages that are commonly written non-cursively, segmentation techniques may be used in HWR systems.
also may use segmentation techniques since human handwriting 
touching characters are error prone in segmentation stage that contributes to recognition errors.

A through survey on character segmentation is given in \cite{casey1996survey} and \cite{brodowska2011oversegmentation}.

\section{Problem Definition}

The growing use of keyboard-less handheld devices accelerates a transition in the Human-Computer data input interface.  While in the past, keyboards and mice were the primary mode of data entry, nowadays, hand and finger gestures are increasingly used for this task. Consequently, a growing interest in the online character recognition field has taken place. Automated script recognition of Latin, Chinese and Kanji has been a focus of study in the last decade and impressive recognition rates were achieved. However, Arabic text recognition is at an early stage. The reason for this is lack of funds and other utilities such as text database, dictionaries, etc. [2]
Text recognition can be classified into two main fields: online and offline recognition. Online recognition aims recognizing the text as it is being written. However, in the offline script recognition field, a digital image containing text is fed to the computers and the system attempt to recognise the written text [3]. The main existing approaches for script recognition are the holistic approach and the analytic approach. The holistic approach considers the global properties of the written text while the analytic approach involves segmentation and classification of each part of the text. 
Arabic text, both handwritten and printed is cursive. An Arabic word consists of one or more sub-words (which will be referred to as word parts). Each word part consists of one character or more. Thus, most of the online Arabic recognition systems perform the recognition soon after the word part scribing is completed using the holistic or the analytic approach. The analysis of Arabic script is further due to obligatory dots and stokes that are placed above or below most letters in addition to the wide range variety of writing fashions.
In this thesis we propose a novel approach which combines both holistic and analytic techniques for recognizing open dictionary Arabic online script. The recognition process, in our approach, is performed whilst the word part is being written. At the first stage, demarcation points are identified using SVM. At the second stage we employ an agile but loose classifier to select letters candidates for each segment. Finally, we holistically recognize the word part by applying a costly yet accurate classifier.

\section{Scope}
As mentioned before, Arabic is a cursive written language and it contains about 40k possible word parts. By "possible", we mean that there is an Arabic word which contains the word part. Arabic letters may differ by additional stroke above or beneath the main stroke. For example, the Arabic letter \RL{f} (Fa) contains a single dot above the main stroke, however the letter \RL{q} (Qa), contains double dots, both having identical main body. In our work we recognize and classify the main body of the letter and ignore the additional stroke entirely. As a result, the number of different letters drops from 29 to18 and the number of different possible word parts decreases to []. It is important to comment that taking the additional strokes into consideration may be exploited to boost the classification rate.
The Arabic letters system contain 7 sets of letters that have the same body, and are differentiated only by the additional strokes above or under it. The following table describes the sets of similarity:

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Arabic letters shapes similarities}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c |}
\hline
Letter Set & Positions of similarity\\
\hline                 
  \RL{b}, \RL{t}, \RL{_t} & All Positions\\ 
  \hline
  \RL{`}, \RL{.g} & All Positions\\
  \hline
  \RL{.h}, \RL{j}, \RL{x} & All Positions\\
  \hline
  \RL{f}, \RL{q} & All Positions (very slight differences\\ 
   					&in Isolated mode, the valley of the letter \RL{q} is deeper)\\
  \hline
  \RL{r}, \RL{z} & Isolated\\
  \hline
  \RL{h}, \RL{T} & Isolated\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\centering
\label{table:letters_similarity} 
\end{table}

The main body of most Arabic letters is written by a single stroke. However, there are some letters that usually written using 2 strokes, such as the letter \RL{-k-}  which is the middle form of the letter \RL{k} (Ka). The writer usually writes \RL{-l-} and adds the final upper slanted line when the main body is completed, as if he writes an additional stroke.
Another problem arises when trying to recognize Arabic transcript, is that, different writers may write the main body of the same word part in a different number of strokes. For instance, the main body of the word part \RL{byt} (Bayt - Home), is usually written in a single stroke however, sometimes it may be written by some writers using 3 strokes.
We have also considered the common combination of the letter \RL{l} followed by the vowel \RL{A} as a single letter which is commonly drawn as \RL{lA}. 
Also, three consequent appearances of the letter \RL{-b-} (B) in the middle of the word-part looks as follows: \RL{-bbb-}. As can be seen very similar to the \RL{s} (S) letter in its medial position \RL{-s-}, the only to distinguish between the two options is by looking at the additional strokes.
For these mentioned complexities, when recognizing Arabic scripts, most researches have preferred the holistic approach. 

\section{Contribution to the field}

An Example:
The current study is focused on exploration of possible techniques to develop an OCR system for
Urdu language. A detailed analysis of Urdu writing system has been done in order to understand
the core challenges. Existing OCR systems are also studied to know the latest research going on
in this field. The emphasis was on finding workable segmentation technique and diacritic handling
for Urdu ligatures, and built a recognition module for these ligatures. The complete methodology is
proposed to develop an OCR system for Urdu and a testing application is also made. Test results
are reported and compared with the previous work done in this area.

%\section{Approach Overview}
%
%While the holistic approach is a common technique used for Arabic handwriting recognition, this approach is not practical for recognizing words from the unrestricted dictionary (contains all the words in the Arabic dictionary), since it needs to train the system for each word in the dictionary.  As mentioned in section 2.2 there are about 40,000 valid word parts, with different main strokes. There are much more classes if additional strokes are taken into consideration, practically, a very large number of classes. To overcome this problem, we propose an Arabic word-parts recognizer which breaks up the whole recognition process to 2 restricted recognition tasks. The first is analytical letters classification and the other is holistic word-part recognition from the limited dictionary that contains veritable combinations of letters candidates found in the previous stage. The most significant benefit of this approach is that in both stages the recognition is performed on spaces which contain a very limited class number. 
%
%
%In this section we draw the skeleton of our recognition process. Figure \ref{fig:overview} presents the main flow of our approach followed by a brief description on each stage.

%\subsection{Demarcation Points Nomination}
%The goal of this stage is to decide coarsely but effectively if a certain point is a demarcation point. This stage is performed while the word part is being written. To identify demarcation point we have used the following 2 Arabic demarcation points characteristic: 1. Demarcation point lives in a horizontal region. 2. Demarcation point is usually contained in a Forward region. More details and definitions will follow in a section \emph{[]}. We present a novel algorithm online segmentation using static rules engine. Over segmentation and under-segmentation are the main problems segmentation algorithms encounter. Over segmentation is handled in the next stage. Under-segmentation is handled by a defining a new notion named hyper-letter, which represents combinations of letters that the demarcation points between them is sometimes concealed. More details will be given in section \emph{[]}.
%
%\subsection{Segmentation selection and Letter classification}
%This stage starts when the user finishes to scribe the stroke, i.e. on "pen up" event.  The goal of this sub-process is to select the set of demarcation points which gives the best letter recognition results. This is done after the writer has completed scribing the main body of the stroke. Segmentation induces partition to subsequences, where each subsequent is a geometric representation of a letter (or a combination or letters). The subsequence is classified to a set of 3 or candidate letters using a combination of EMD and DTW metrics. The quality scoring of the segmentation is based on the recognition score of each letter which is calculated using dynamic programming technique. 
%
%\subsection{Candidate Word-Part generation and embedding}
%After the segmentation is determined and each sub-sequent was classified to a small set of hyper-letters candidates, the system generate all possible word-parts sequences using the samples of hyper-letters in our letters database using the most common ways to write the hyper-letter. Here we use the Holistic approach to classify the word-part. However, instead of taking the whole dictionary of possible word-parts, our space of candidate word part only samples of word parts combinations of letters nominated in the previous stage. Subsequently, we extract the features of the generated word-parts and embed them using approximate Earth Movers Distance (EMD) approach described by Shirdhonkar and Jacobs in \cite{shirdhonkar2008approximate}.
%
%\subsection{Candidate Word-Part generation and embedding}
%The number of possible different word-parts is relatively small. Assume that the written word part composed of 4 letters. For every letter, the second stage has nominated 3 different letters. In the worst case when all combinations are legal, we get at most $3^4=27$ different possible word-parts. However, the number of different samples created is very large. Thus, we need a fast classification approach to overcome this obstacle. 
%EMD is a true metric, thus we can utilize a recently developed tool which allow fast (sub linear time) approximate nearest neighbor (NN) named Linear Sensitivity Hashing (LSH) presented by Gionis et al in \cite{gionis1999similarity}. LSH indexes a set of training examples living in a normed space by a number of hash tables, such that the probability of collision is high for similar examples and low for dissimilar ones. In this stage, the system initializes an LSH data structure with the set of word parts generated in the previous stage and use it to efficiently find the most similar word-parts.
