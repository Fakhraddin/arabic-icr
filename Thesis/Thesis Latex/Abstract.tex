\chapter*{Abstract}

The cursive and unconstrained nature of the Arabic script, in both printed and handwritten forms, anneals the task of segmentation. 
While real-time performance is required in applications involving on-line handwriting recognition, most techniques for handwriting recognition wait until the entire curve is traced out before starting the analysis, inevitably causing delays in the recognition process. 
This paper proposes a novel, ongoing, recognition-based segmentation technique of the on-line Arabic script, by carrying out the most time consuming recognition process while the stroke is being scribed. 
The system has been designed and tested using the ADAB Database, and promising results were obtained.
