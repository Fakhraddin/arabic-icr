\chapter*{Abstract}
 
Correct and efficient recognition of handwritten Arabic text is considered to be an essential problem due to the cursive and unconstrained nature of the Arabic script.
While real-time performance is necessary in applications involving on-line handwriting recognition, conventional approaches usually wait until the entire curve is traced out before starting the analysis, inevitably causing delays in the recognition process. 
This suspension restricts on-line recognition techniques to meet the highly responsiveness demands expected from such systems, and prevents implementing advanced features of input typing, such as automatic word completion and real-time automatic spelling.

This work proposes a real-time approach for segmentation and recognition of handwritten on-line Arabic script.
We demonstrate the feasibility of segmenting and classifying while the stroke is being written.
The system is implemented using two parts, the real-time stroke segmentation system and the fast character classifier.
The real-time segmentation is facilitated using a fast letters classifier employing linear time embedding technique of advanced similarity measure techniques into the wavelet coefficient normed space, allowing fast similarity search.
We demonstrate that the resulted segmentation and letters classification information can be used to significantly reduce the potential dictionary size and accelerate a later holistic recognition process.

The system has been designed and tested using the ADAB Database, and promising results were obtained.
