\chapter*{Abstract}
 
Correct and efficient recognition of handwritten Arabic text is considered to be a complex problem due to the cursive and unconstrained nature of the Arabic script.
While real-time performance is necessary in applications involving on-line handwriting recognition, conventional approaches usually wait until the entire curve is traced out before starting the analysis, inevitably causing delays in the recognition process. 
This deferment restricts on-line recognition techniques from achieving highly responsiveness demands expected from such systems, and prevents implementing advanced features of input typing, such as automatic word completion and real-time automatic spelling.

This work proposes a real-time approach for segmenting and recognizing handwritten on-line Arabic script.
It demonstrate the feasibility of carrying out time consuming analysis and classification tasks during the course of writing. 
The presented real-time recognition-based segmentation method is facilitated using a fast letters classifier. 
It employs linear-time embedding technique of the feature space into the wavelet coefficient normed space, facilitating the usage of state-of-the-art, fast and accurate similarity measure and search techniques.
We show that the resulting segmentation and letters classification information can be used to significantly reduce the potential dictionary size and accelerate a later holistic recognition process.

The system has been designed and tested using the ADAB Database, and promising results were obtained.
