This research would not have been possible without the support of many people. 
I wish to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Dana Ron, for her inspiration, invaluable assistance in this research and her insightful comments on this thesis.

I would like to sincerely thank my second supervisor, Dr. Raid Saabne, for introducing me to this fascinating field; for his endless efforts pushing me forward and believing in me; for directing me through the hard times and providing me with invaluable advices, which I will take for life.

There is a famous metaphorical Arabic statement, which was used to be written on the walls of schools, that I would like to devote to my instructors and all the teachers during my lifetime, to express my deep appreciation to them.

\begin{center}
\RL{man `llmny .hrfaN, .srto laho `bdaN Arb`yn `AmaN}\\
''For him, who has taught me a single letter, I will be a servant for forty years.'' 
\end{center}

Finally, I wish to express my love and gratitude to my parents, Micheal and Rimona, and to my brothers for their unconditional support and love. 
Words alone cannot express my deep emotions for them.\\
