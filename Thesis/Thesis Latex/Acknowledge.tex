This research would not have been possible without the support of many people. 
I wish to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Dana Ron, for her inspiration, invaluable assistance, patient in guidance and caring.
I am extremely lucky to have the chance to work with such a great scientist.  

I want to sincerely thank my second supervisor, Dr. Raid Saabne, for introducing me to this fascinating field; for his endless efforts pushing me forward and believing in me; for directing me through the hard times and providing me with invaluable advices which I will take for life.

To my teachers, I would like to devote a famous Arabic quotation, which was traditionally written on walls of schools:

\begin{center}
\RL{man `llmny .hrfaN, .srto laho `bdaN.}\\
''For him, who has taught me a single letter, I will be a servant.'' 
\end{center}

Finally, I wish to express my love and gratitude to my parents, Micheal and Rimona Kour, my three beloved brothers and friends, for their endless love and unconditional support. 
Words alone cannot express my deep emotions to them.\\

\hfill \textbf{\em George}
