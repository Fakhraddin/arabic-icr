\section{Citations}

The file references.bib in this folder is an example of how to organize
the bibliography database. It is very simple to add a reference/citation
to one of the items in the bibliography list, e.g. see the best source
of information regarding the OpenPTV origins: \citet{Dracos1996}.
Simply use: Insert -> Citation and choose from the list on the left.
Add it to the list on the right and you'll be able to choose the format
of author-year or author-number or just number to the references.
At the same time, at the end of the document you'll find References
chapter with all the cited references automatically chosen and included.
